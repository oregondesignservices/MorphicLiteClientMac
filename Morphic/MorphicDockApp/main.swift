// NOTE: as our dock app doesn't have a menu (and we want to manually create that menu if we're going to support it), we use main.swift to startup instead of MainMenu.xib+AppDelegate.

let applicationDelegate = AppDelegate()
//
// set our application's delegate
NSApplication.shared.delegate = applicationDelegate
//
// launch our application (starting up the application delegate) using optionally-provided command-line arguments
